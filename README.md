I began this website practice in Week 4 of the bootcamp when we were beginning to learn CSS.
After making media queries in CSS with the BioLingual project, I'm considering creating a Version 3
file that will begin styling from a smartphone-sized breakpoint.

I still like the layout of the menu all on the first page.
